A.  If the New Balance shown on this statement is paid in full by the Payment Due Date shown on this statement, no INTEREST CHARGE will be imposed on Current Cycle Purchases (which are the
purchases itemized on this statement). Each cash advance under your account will be subject to an INTEREST CHARGE beginning on the date the advance is posted to your account. INTEREST
CHARGES will continue to accrue on your account until the entire outstanding balance is paid in full.
B.  We figure the INTEREST CHARGE on your account by applying the periodic rate, as stated in your Account Opening Disclosure to the "average daily balance" of your account. To get the "average
daily balance" we take the beginning balance of your account each day, add any new purchases/advances, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any payments or credits. This
gives us the daily balance. Then, we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives us the "average daily balance."
If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at:
MIT FEDERAL CREDIT UNION
PO BOX 10409 DES MOINES, IA 50306
In your letter, give us the following information:
:  Your name and account number.
:  The dollar amount of the suspected error.
:   If you think there is an error on your bill,  describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.
You must contact us within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.
You must notify us of any potential errors . You may call us, but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error, the following are true:
We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.
The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount. But, if we determine that we made a mistake, you will not have to pay the
amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.
While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you  are responsible for the remainder of your balance.
We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to
pay the remaining amount due on the purchase. To use this right, all of the following must be true:
The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are
necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)
You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.
You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.
If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us  at:
MIT FEDERAL CREDIT UNION
PO BOX 10409 DES MOINES, IA 50306
While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and
you do not pay we may report you as delinquent.
