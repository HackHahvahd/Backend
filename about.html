        <h2>Mission</h2>
          <p>MissionCode is a platform created to facilitate the connection between students and nonprofits.
            Our mission is to help college students connect with nonprofits and apply the technical skills they learn
            in class in helping nonprofits in their cause(s). MissionCode will match the interests that the students have
            with the interests and social causes of the nonprofits through the resumes that the students
            submit through the platform.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
          <p>A student will create an account on the web application. After, he or she will have the option
            to submit his or her resume online, where MissionCode will scan the resume and determine and match any nonprofits
            that align with the student's interests. If there are nonprofits that match the interests of the student, he or she
            can contact the nonprofit and voice his or her interest in helping the nonprofit, whether it is to develop a website
            for them or to create a reservation system. The possibilities are practically endlessly.</p>
